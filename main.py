    Welcome to our Lunar Crater Detection System! ðŸŒ•ðŸ”­

    Our mission is to help you identify lunar craters efficiently. Please upload an image of the lunar surface, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of craters. Together, let's explore the moon and enhance our understanding of its topography!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Crater Detection** page and upload an image of the lunar surface.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential craters.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further analysis.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate crater detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Crater Detection** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Lunar Crater Detection System!

    ### About Us
    Learn more about the project, our team, and our goals on the **About** page.

    ## About Dataset
    ### Why this dataset
    Efficient detection of craters can be of vital significance in various space exploration missions. Previous researches have already made significant progress on this task, however the versatility and robustness of existing methods are still limited. While modern object detection methods using deep learning is gaining popularity and is probably a solution to aforementioned problems, public-accessible data for training is hard to find. This is the primary reason we propose this dataset.

    ### What's in the dataset
    The dataset mainly contains:

    Image Data: Images of Mars and Moon surface which MAY contain craters. The data source is mixed. For Mars images, images are mainly from ASU and USGS; Currently all Moon images are from NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. All images are preprocessed with RoboFlow to remove EXIF rotation and resize to 640*640.
    Labels: Each image has its associated labelling file in YOLOv5 text format. The anotation work was performed by ourselves, and mainly serves the purpose of object detection.
    Trained YOLOv5 model file: For each new version, we will upload our pretrained YOLOv5 model file using the latest version of data. The network strcture currently in use is YOLOv5m6.
